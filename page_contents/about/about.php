  <h1 class="w3-xlarge">ABOUT ME</h1>
  <img src="/images/profile.jpg" width="30%" align="left" style="padding-right: 15px;"> My name is Arthur Kamienski, I am 21 years old and I am a student at the <a href="http://ufabc.edu.br">Federal University of ABC (UFABC)</a> in Santo André, São Paulo, Brazil. I am currently studying Computer Sciences and I should be done in December 2019.<br><br>
  
  I consider myself a geek, with a deep love for programming, games and tecnology in general, and heavy influences of pop culture.<br><br>
  
  I am a purple belt in Brazillian Jiu Jitsu, a sport which I have been practicing for nearly 5 years now.<br><br>
  
  In my free time I like to read (I have just finished "A Song of Ice and Fire" and that is an accomplishment to me), to watch movies (I don't have any favourites, but I do like Interstellar, Guardians of the Galaxy and Amelie) and TV series (currently Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Game of Thrones) and most importantly: <b>I love to code!</b><br><br>
  
  Throughout my still short carreer as a computer scientist, I have been in contact with many different programming languages and programming tools, most notably: Python, Java, C/C++,  SQL, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, Haskell, R, VHDL.<br><br>
  
  Currently I am interested in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning and Web development.<br><br>

  <h1 class="w3-xlarge">ABOUT THE WEBSITE</h1>
  
  This website was created in October 2018, as a way to share the applications that I was developing in Javascript with my friends and family.<br><br>
  
  Soon, the whole website became a project itself, and I started improving it and adapting it to my likes and needs.<br><br>
  
  Now the website is mostly used as a place where I can test new web applications and make school projects. It also serves as a portfolio and a place where I can show to any and everyone the things I have been working on.
