  <img class="profile-pic" src="/images/profile.jpg"> My name is Arthur Kamienski, I am a <span id="age"></span> year old computer scientist and researcher from Brazil.<br><br>

  Currently (as of September 2020), I am an MSc student in Software Engineering and Intelligent Systems at the <a target="_blank" href="http://ualberta.ca">University of Alberta</a> in Edmonton, Canada. I am also a member of the <a target="_blank" href="http://asgaard.ece.ualberta.ca">Analytics of Software, GAmes And Repository Data (ASGAARD) lab</a>, where I do research on Game Development Q&amp;A websites.<br><br>

  Previously, I obtained my BSc in Computer Science from the <a target="_blank" href="http://ufabc.edu.br">Federal University of ABC (UFABC)</a> in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in December, 2020.<br><br>
  
  My current interests are working with and analyzing data, and Applied Machine Learning. I also enjoy working on NLP problems, even thought that is not my focus right now. In the past, I have worked with Academic Genealogical Graphs at the Future Internet and Data Science (FIDS) lab at the Federal University of ABC (UFABC).<br><br>

  <h2 class="w3-xlarge">HOBBIES</h2>

  I consider myself a geek with a deep love for programming, games and tecnology in general, and heavy influences of pop culture.<br><br>
  
  I am a purple belt in Brazillian Jiu Jitsu, a sport which I have practiced for nearly 5 years. I also enjoy running outdoor, specially in parks. My personal best so far is 10km.<br><br>
  
  In my free time I like to play games (such as League of Legends and Assassin's Creeed), to read (I have just finished "A Song of Ice and Fire" and that is an accomplishment to me), to watch movies (I don't have any favourites, but I do like Interstellar, Guardians of the Galaxy and Amelie, to name a few) and TV series (favorites include Game of Thrones, Rick and Morty, and Vikings) and most importantly: <b>I love to code!</b><br><br>
  
  Throughout my carreer as a computer scientist, I have been in contact with many different programming languages and programming tools, most notably: Python, Java, R, JavaScript, Scala, Kotlin, C/C++, PHP, Haskell. My favorite programming language is Haskell, although I am not very good at it. I do most of my work using Python.<br><br>

  <h1 class="w3-large">ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</h1>
  
  This website was created in October 2018 when I was an exchange student in Offenburg, Germany. I was taking a course on web applications and I made this website as a way to share the applications that I was developing with my friends and family. Soon, the whole website became a project itself, and I started improving it and adapting it to my likes and needs. Now the website is mostly used as a place where I can test new web applications and make school projects. It also serves as a portfolio and a place where I can display the things I have been working on.<br><br>

  When it was first started, this website was hosted on an AWS EC2 instance using a LAMP stack and everything was (and probably still is) really crude. I was starting to learn HTML, CSS and PHP and this was intended as a learning exercise for improving my skills.<br><br>

  Most of the applications here were build from scratch, without the use of any tool other than programming libraries and a text editor. This may change over time, as I plan to test new technologies and frameworks to improve this site. Therefore, do note that this website is a work in progress.<br><br>
