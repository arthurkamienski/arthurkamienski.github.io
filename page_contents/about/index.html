  <h1 class="w3-xlarge">ABOUT ME</h1>
  <img class="profile-pic" src="/images/profile.jpg"> My name is Arthur Kamienski; I am a <span id="age"></span>-year-old computer scientist and researcher from Brazil.<br><br>

  Currently (as of September 2020), I am an MSc student in Software Engineering and Intelligent Systems at the <a target="_blank" href="http://ualberta.ca">University of Alberta</a> in Edmonton, Canada. I am also a member of the <a target="_blank" href="http://asgaard.ece.ualberta.ca">Analytics of Software, GAmes, And Repository Data (ASGAARD) lab</a>, where I research Game Development Q&amp;A websites.<br><br>

  I previously obtained my BSc in Computer Science from the <a target="_blank" href="http://ufabc.edu.br">Federal University of ABC (UFABC)</a> in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in December 2019.<br><br>
  
  My current interests are working with and analyzing pretty much any kind of data: I guess my work could be classified as "Applied Data Science". I also enjoy working on NLP problems, even though that is not my focus right now. In the past, I have worked with Academic Genealogical Graphs at the Future Internet and Data Science (FIDS) lab at the Federal University of ABC (UFABC).<br><br>

  In the past, I have worked as a Data Science Intern on FinTech startups (<a target="_blank" href="https://nubank.com.br/en/about-us/">Nubank</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://https://www.jeitto.com.bri/about-us">Jeitto</a>) and helped to build and improve financial models to provide better personal loans to customers.<br><br>

  <h2 class="w3-xlarge">HOBBIES</h2>

  I consider myself a geek with a deep love for programming, games, and technology in general, and heavy pop culture influences.<br><br>
  
  I am a purple belt in Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu, a sport I have practiced for nearly five years. I also enjoy running outdoor, especially in parks. My personal best so far is 10km.<br><br>
  
  In my free time, I like to play games, watch movies and TV series, read, and most importantly:<br> <b>I love to code!</b><br><br>

  As a computer scientist, I have been in contact with many different programming languages and programming tools, most notably: Python, Java, R, JavaScript, Scala, Kotlin, C/C++, PHP, Haskell. My favorite programming language is Haskell, although I am not very good at it. I do most of my work using Python.<br><br>

  <h1 class="w3-large">ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</h1>
  
  This website was created in October 2018 when I was an exchange student in Offenburg, Germany. I took a course on web applications and made this website for sharing the applications that I was developing with my friends and family. The web page soon became a project itself, and I started improving it and adapting it to my likes and needs. Now the website is mostly used as a place where I can test new web applications and make school projects. It also serves as a portfolio and a place where I can display the things I have been working on.<br><br>

  When it was first started, this website was hosted on an AWS EC2 instance using a LAMP stack, and everything was (and probably still is) really crude. I was starting to learn HTML, CSS, and PHP, and this was intended as a learning exercise for improving my skills.<br><br>

  Most of the applications here were built from scratch, without using any tools other than programming libraries and a text editor. This may change over time, as I plan to test new technologies and frameworks to improve this site. Therefore, do note that this website is a work in progress.<br><br>
