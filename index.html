          You just accessed the akamienski.ml website!

          <h3>This website is a work in progress.</h3>

          This website was created by <b>Arthur Kamienski</b> as a place to test online applications and display his works and projects.<br><br>

          Most of the applications here were build from scratch, without the use of any tool or pre-programmed software. The layout was borrowed from W3Schools.<br><br>

          This whole website was built and coded using a text editor and LAMP.<br><br>

          If you would like, browse the games and try the The Chat Room out.<br><br>

          For more informations, please contact me through any of the means available in the  "Contact" tab.<br><br>

          New features are constantly being added. Check back again later to see what's new!
