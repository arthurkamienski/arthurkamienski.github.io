      You just accessed <b>Arthur Kamienski</b>'s personal website!<br><br>

      This website was first created on October 2018 as a place to test the online applications I created and to display my works and projects. Back then, this website was hosted on an AWS EC2 instance using a LAMP stack and everything was (and probably still is) really crude. I was starting to learn HTML, CSS and PHP and this was intended as a learning exercise for improving my skills.<br><br>

      Most of the applications here were build from scratch, without the use of any tool other than programming libraries and a text editor. This may change over time, as I plan to test new technologies and frameworks to improve this site. Therefore, do note that<br><br>

      <h3>This website is a work in progress.</h3><br>

      Please, get yourself acquainted: browse through the other pages and see if you find anything interesting. I recommend you to take a look at the "Games" page - I spend quite a lot of time playing with JavaScript to create simple games, and I find them quite fun!<br><br>

      For more informations, please contact me through any of the means available in the  "Contact" tab.<br><br>

      New features are constantly being added. Check back again later to see what's new!
